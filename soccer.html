      <h2>Soccer</h2>

<p>I have played soccer all my life. I have tried many sports but have always made my way back to soccer.</p>

<p>Other sports I have tried are, volleyball, basketball, and tennis. I played volleyball for one season and didn't like it because it made my arms hurt. I played basketball but when I tried out for the middle school team I got cut, and I was never super serious about it so I just quit. I played tennis because my grandfather paid for my lessons. I really enjoyed it but once soccer season came around I put tennis on the back burner. My mom says that tennis is a great old person sport to play so maybe when I can't sprint down the field anymore, I will pick up my tennis racket.</p>
                                                                                
<p>I have played soccer for almost 13 years. I played rec soccer until 7th grade then I started playing for a team called FC Bellbrook. Currently I play for a soccer club named Fusion. In the fall I play for the high school team. I have played two years of high school soccer and have loved every minute I have spent with my team. I played for the JV-A team my freshman and sophmore year.</p>

 <p>After my sophmore year of soccer, I revieved an award for the most improved player on the JV-A team. They gave me this award because coming into my freshman year I was terrified of actually playing because I wasn't confident in my abilities. Well at the end of the season, they told me to become more confident person in how I play soccer. I worked so hard over the winter season and spring to try and do what they asked. I would say it payed off.</p>
 
<p>Here is a video of my team all jumping. We took this video because we would always tell the coach that we didn't like playing varsity because they were very good. Our coach would always say they just put their pants on differently than us. So we always joked that they put their pants on by jumping into them. So everytime we played varsity and we got the opportunity to score we would always jump up and put our pants on like this.</p>
