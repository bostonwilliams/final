        <h2>My Childhood</h2>
      
        <p>I began my life on the morning of Friday May 30th 2003. I was born to two loving parents Douglas and Julie Williams. When I was born I had one older brother Garrison. Currently I have four sibilings, Garrison, Chase, Luke, and Eliza.</p>

      <p>I went to West Carrollton schools until 7th grade when my family and I moved to Bellbrook. I went to Harold Schnell Elementary School. It was year around, which means that you had a short summer vacation, but you would have several 3 week breaks in between. I went to West Carrollton Middle School for one year, I enjoyed it there. Then seventh grade I started going to Bellbrook Middle School. I really liked it there. I am currently a sophmore at Bellbrook High School, and it is great! </p>

        <p>In my childhood, I lived next to my grandparents until we moved. I loved living next to my grandparents because I would go over for piano lessons, to play our favorite game Monopoly, or just to talk with them. On snow days we would go over and play games until it was time for dinner. </p>

        <p>In my house we had a lot of great traditions. For Christmas we would always decorate gingerbread houses, and cut down our own tree at this little farm we always went too. On Christmas Eve we all sleep in the same room, then we have to stay in our room until 7:00am, then we would go downstairs, open our stockings and eat our special Christmas breakfast. We also have celebrated half-birthdays. When we celebrate someone's half birthday we make them half of a cake, give them a half box of candy, give them half of a card, and in the card there is two, five dollar bills (We would normally give them 20, but we cut that in half, then cut the 10 in half) and sing half of the birthday song to them. </p>
