        <h2>Welcome to the Website All About Me!</h2>
      
        <p>I began my life on the morning of Friday May 30th 2003. I was born to two loving parents Douglas and Julie Williams. When I was born I had one older brother Garrison. Currently I have four sibilings, Garrison, Chase, Luke, and Eliza.</p>

      <p>I went to West Carrollton schools until 7th grade when my family and I moved to Bellbrook. I went to Harold Schnell Elementary School. It was year around, which means that you had a short summer vacation, but you would have several 3 week breaks in between. I went to West Carrollton Middle School for one year, I enjoyed it there. Then seventh grade I started going to Bellbrook Middle School. I really liked it there. I am currently a sophmore at Bellbrook High School, and it is great! </p>
