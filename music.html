      <h2>Music</h2>
           <h3> Piano </h3>
<p>I enjoy playing the piano. I have played the piano all my life. I used to take piano lessons everyday from my grandmother, but every since we moved she just comes every Wednesday. I also take piano lessons from another person who lives in Kettering. The reason I do that is complicated. </p>
           <h3> Guitar </h3>
<p>My father taught me how to play the guitar. I wanted to learn how to play in the 6th grade, I learned a couple of chords but I started actually learning around 8th grade. I don't play as much guitar as piano, just because I do not take lessons for it, but I really enjoy playing. </p>
