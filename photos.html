   <p>This is an inside joke with our team. We were scared to play varsity because they are really good. But our coach said they just play differently than us or they put their pants on differently.</p>

     <h2>Sports</h2>
     <p>I have played soccer all my life. I have played many other sports but have always made my way back to soccer.</p>

<p>Other sports I have tried are, volleyball, basketball, and tennis. I played volleyball for one season and didn't like it because it made my arms hurt. I played basketball but when I tried out for the middle school team I got cut, and I was never super serious about it so I just quit. I played tennis because my grandfather paid for my lessons. I really enjoyed it but once soccer season came around I put tennis on the back burner. My mom says that tennis is a great old person sport to play, so maybe when I can't sprint down the field anymore, I will pick up my tennis racket.</p>

     <h2>High School Soccer</h2>
      <p>After my sophmore year of soccer, I revieved an award for the most improved player on the JV-A team. They gave me this award because coming into my freshman year I was terrified of actually playing because I wasn't confident in my abilities. Well at the end of the season, they told me to become more confident person in how I play soccer. I worked so hard over the winter season and spring to try and do what they asked.</p>
