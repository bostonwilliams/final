      <h2>Soccer</h2>

<p>I have played soccer all my life. I have tried many sports but have always made my way back to this one.</p>

<p>Other sports I have tried are, volleyball, basketball, and tennis. I played volleyball for one season and didn't like it because it made my arms hurt. I played basketball but when I tried out for the middle school team I got cut, and I was never super serious about it so I just quit. I played tennis because my grandfather paid for my lessons. I really enjoyed it but once soccer season came around I put tennis on the back burner. My mom says that tennis is a great old person sport to play so maybe when I can't sprint down the feild anymore, I will pick up my tennis racket.</p>
                                                                                
<p>I have played soccer for almost 13 years. I played rec soccer until 7th grade then I started playing for a team called FC Bellbrook. Currently I play for a soccer club named Fusion. In the fall I play for the high school team. I have played two years of high school soccer and have loved all the times I have spent with my team. I played for the JV-A team this year and I am hoping to make varsity this coming fall.</p>
