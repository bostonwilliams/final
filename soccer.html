<p>Here is a video of my team all jumping. We took this video because we would always tell the coach that we didn't like playing varsity because they were very good. Our coach would always say they just put their pants on differently than us. So we always joked that they put their pants on by jumping into them. So everytime we played varsity and we got the opportunity to score we would always jump up and put our pants on like this.</p>
